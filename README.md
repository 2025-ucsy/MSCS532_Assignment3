# MSCS532 Assignment 3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

## üìÑ Description

This project implements and analyzes two fundamental data structures and algorithms:
- **QuickSort**: A randomized sorting algorithm that demonstrates average-case efficiency on various dataset sizes.
- **Hash Table**: A custom-built hash table to evaluate load factor effects and collision behavior at different capacities.

The goal is to examine how theoretical time complexities translate into real-world performance through benchmarking and analysis.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2025-ucsy/MSCS532_Assignment3.git
   cd MSCS532_Assignment3
3. Run the program:
   python main.py
   
This will help:

Sort an array using randomized QuickSort

Demonstrate Hash Table insertions, lookups, and removals

Benchmark QuickSort performance at multiple sizes

Analyze hash table load factors and collision rates
